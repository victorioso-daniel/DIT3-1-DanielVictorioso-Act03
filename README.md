## Project Description
This project is an Android app that displays a simple **Profile Screen** using a clean and responsive UI design.  
The layout includes:
- A profile picture (ImageView)  
- The user’s name (TextView)  
- A short bio or description (TextView)  
- An edit button (Button)  

The goal is to apply good UI/UX design principles using **ConstraintLayout**, proper spacing, readable text, and consistent styling.

## Reflection

**1. What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?**  
I used a light background with dark text for better readability. The name text is bold and centered, while the bio text is smaller and has a softer tone. The layout uses **ConstraintLayout** to keep everything aligned properly, and the button color matches the app’s accent theme.

**2. How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?**  
I used proper text sizing (`sp`) and spacing (`dp`) for consistent scaling. I also made sure there’s enough contrast between text and background. The layout stays neat and readable in both portrait and landscape mode.

**3. What would you improve if this were a real app?**  
If this were a real app, I’d make the Edit button functional, allow users to update their photo and bio, and add dark mode support for better accessibility.
