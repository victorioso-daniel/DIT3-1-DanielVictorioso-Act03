## 📱 Project Description
This project is an Android app that displays a clean and responsive **Profile Screen**.  
The layout includes:
- A **profile picture (ImageView)**  
- The **user’s name (TextView)**  
- A **short bio or description (TextView)**  
- An **edit button (Button)**  

The goal is to demonstrate good **UI/UX design principles** using **ConstraintLayout**, balanced spacing, readable typography, and consistent color styling.

## 🧠 Reflection

**1. What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?**  
I used a light background with dark text for better readability. The user’s name is bold and centered, while the bio uses a smaller, softer tone for contrast.  
The layout is built with **ConstraintLayout** to maintain alignment and balance. The edit button color complements the app’s accent theme.

**2. How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?**  
I used appropriate text sizing (`sp`) and spacing (`dp`) for better scaling across different screens.  
There’s enough color contrast between text and background for readability, and the layout adapts well to both portrait and landscape modes.

**3. What would you improve if this were a real app?**  
If this were a real app, I’d add functionality to the **Edit** button, allow users to change their photo and bio, and implement **dark mode** for accessibility and user preference.
